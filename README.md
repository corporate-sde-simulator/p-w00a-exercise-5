## 🆕 Never Coded Before?

**Start with Exercise 0!** It teaches programming from absolute scratch — no prior experience needed. It covers what variables, loops, functions, and errors are, with real-world analogies and tiny, guided exercises.

## Recommended Path

### If you've NEVER coded before:
```
Exercise 0 → Exercise 7 → Exercise 1 → Exercise 2 → Exercise 6
    ↑              ↑            ↑            ↑            ↑
 Learn basics   Terminal    Python deep   JavaScript   Bug finding
```

### If you've coded but are new to Python/JS:
```
Exercise 7 → Exercise 1 → Exercise 2 → 3, 4, 5 → Exercise 6
    ↑            ↑            ↑          ↑             ↑
 Terminal    Python deep   JavaScript  Other langs  Bug finding
```

## What Each Exercise Teaches

### Core Concepts (Exercise 0-1)
| Concept | Where | Why You Need It |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Variables, loops, functions | Ex-0 | Building blocks of ALL code |
| Classes & OOP | Ex-1 | Every task uses classes |
| Error handling (try/except) | Ex-0, Ex-1 | Code that doesn't crash |
| Dictionaries | Ex-0, Ex-1 | Data is stored as key-value pairs |

### Advanced Concepts (Exercise 1-2)
| Concept | Where | Why You Need It |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Async/Await & Promises | JS Ex-2 | Every Node.js task uses it |
| Callbacks | JS Ex-2 | Older codebases use them |
| Threading & Locks | Python Ex-1 | Connection pools, workers |
| JSON parsing/merging | Ex-1, Ex-2 | Config files everywhere |
| Regular Expressions | Ex-1, Ex-2 | Log parsing, validation |
| Decorators | Python Ex-1 | Common Python pattern |
| Logging | Python Ex-1 | Every Python task uses it |

## Running Tests

| Exercise | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Exercise 0 (Beginner) | `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v` |
| Exercise 1 (Python) | `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v` |
| Exercise 2 (JavaScript) | `node test_exercise.js` |
| Exercise 3 (TypeScript) | `npx ts-node test_exercise.ts` |
| Exercise 4 (Go) | `go test -v -race` |
| Exercise 5 (Java) | `javac Starter.java && java Starter` |
| Exercise 6 (Bugs) | `python -m pytest test_bugfixes.py -v` |

## When You're Done

Once all tests pass in all exercises, you're ready for **Week 1**!

In Week 1 you'll encounter real JIRA tickets with buggy production code.
Everything you learned here — variables, functions, async, threading,
JSON, regex, debugging — is exactly what you'll need.

**You've got this!** 💪
